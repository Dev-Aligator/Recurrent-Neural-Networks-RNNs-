\begin{abstract}
  State-of-the-art solutions in the areas of “Language Modelling \& Generating Text”,
  “Speech Recognition”, “Generating Image Descriptions” or “Video Tagging” have
  been using Recurrent Neural Networks as the foundation for their approaches.
  Understanding the underlying concepts is therefore of tremendous importance if
  we want to keep up with recent or upcoming publications in those areas. In this
  work we give a short overview over some of the most important concepts in the
  realm of Recurrent Neural Networks which enables readers to easily understand
  the fundamentals such as but not limited to “Backpropagation through Time” or
  “Long Short-Term Memory Units” as well as some of the more recent advances like
  the “Attention Mechanism” or “Pointer Networks”. We also give recommendations
  for further reading regarding more complex topics where it is necessary.

\section{Introduction \& Notation}
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture which is mainly used
to detect patterns in a sequence of data. Such data can be handwriting, genomes, text or numerical
time series which are often produced in industry settings (e.g. stock markets or sensors).
However, they are also applicable to images if these get respectively decomposed into a series of
patches and treated as a sequence. On a higher level, RNNs find applications in Language
Modelling \& Generating Text, Speech Recognition, Generating Image Descriptions or Video Tagging.
What differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks from Feedforward Neural Networks also known
as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) is how information gets passed through the network. While
Feedforward Networks pass information through the network without cycles, the RNN has cycles and
transmits information back into itself. This enables them to extend the functionality of Feedforward
Networks to also take into account previous inputs $X_{0:t-1}$ and not only the current input $X_t$. This
difference is visualised on a high level in Figure 1. Note, that here the option of having multiple
hidden layers is aggregated to one Hidden Layer block H. This block can obviously be extended to
multiple hidden layers.
\subsection{Model Architecture}
RNNs add recurrent layers to the NN (Neural Network)
model and consists of three sets of layers (input, recurrent, and output).
Input layers take the sensor output and convert it into a vector
that conveys the features of the input. These are followed by
the recurrent layers, which provide feedback. In most recent
recurrent layer models, memory cells exist as well. Subse-
quently, the model completes similarly to most NN models
with Fully Connected (FC) layers and an output layer that can
be a softmax layer. FC layers and the output layer are grouped
into the set of output layer. \\

We can describe this process of passing information from the previous iteration to the hidden layer
with the mathematical notation proposed in. For that, we denote the hidden state and the input
at time step t respecively as $\mathbf{H}_t$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^{n \times h}$ and $\mathbf{X}_t$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ where n is number of samples, d is the
number of inputs of each sample and h is the number of hidden units. Further, we use a weight matrix
$\mathbf{W}_{xh}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^{d \times h}$, hidden-state-to-hidden-state matrix $\mathbf{W}_{hh}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^{h \times h}$ and a bias parameter $\mathbf{b}_h$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^{1 \times h}$.
Lastly, all these informations get passed to a activation function $\phi$ which is usually a logistic sigmoid
or tanh function to prepair the gradients for usage in backpropagation. Putting all these notations
together yields Equation 1 as the hidden variable and Equation 2 as the output variable.
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{H}_t = \phi_h(\mathbf{X}_t\,\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \mathbf{H}_{t-1}\,\mathbf{W}_{hh} + \mathbf{b}_h)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Visualisation of differences between Feedfoward NNs and Recurrent NNs}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{O}_t = \phi_o (\mathbf{H}_t\,\mathbf{W}_{ho} + \mathbf{b}_o)
\end{equation}
Since $\mathbf{H}_t$ recursively includes $\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ and this process occurs for every time step the RNN includes
traces of all hidden states that preceded $\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ as well as $\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ itself. \\

If we compare that notation for RNNs with similar notation for Feedforward Neural Networks we
can clearly see the difference we described earlier. In Equation 3 we can see the computation for the
hidden variable while Equation 4 shows the output variable.
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{H} = \phi_{o} (\mathbf{X}\,\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \mathbf{b}_h)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{O} = \phi_{o} (\mathbf{H}\,\mathbf{W}_{ho} + \mathbf{b}_o)
\end{equation}

A RNN uses a simple nonlinear activation function in every unit. However, such
simple structure is capable of modelling rich dynamics, if it
is well trained through timesteps.
\subsection{Activation Function}
For linear networks, multiple linear hidden layers act as a
single linear hidden layer. Nonlinear functions are more
powerful than linear functions as they can draw nonlinear
boundaries. The nonlinearity in one or successive hidden
layers in a RNN is the reason for learning input-target re-
lationships.
.The “sigmoid”, “tanh”, and rectified linear unit
(ReLU) have received more attention than the other activation
functions recently. The “sigmoid” is a common choice, which
takes a real-value and squashes it to the range [0, 1]. This
activation function is normally used in the output layer, where
a cross-entropy loss function is used for training a classifica-
tion model. The “tanh” and “sigmoid” activation functions are
defined as
\footnote{Tanh and sigmoid, both functions
require floating-point division and exponential operations,
which are expensive in terms of hardware resources. In order
to have an efficient implementation for an RNN, non-linear
function approximations are implemented in hardware. This
approximation should satisfy a balance between high accuracy and low hardware cost. \\
\textbf{Look-up tables (LUTs), Piecewise linear approximation, Hard tanh / Hard sigmoid, RALUT.}}
\begin{equation}
  tanh(x) = \frac{e^{2x} - 1}{e^{2x} + 1} \:\:\:\:
  \sigma (x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}

Respectively, the “tanh” activation function is in fact a scaled
“sigmoid” activation function such as
\begin{equation}
  \sigma (x) = \frac{tanh(x/2)+1}{2}
\end{equation}
ReLU is another popular activation function, which is open-
ended for positive input values, defined as
\begin{equation}
  y(x) = max(x,0)
\end{equation}
Selection of the activation function is mostly dependent on
the problem and nature of the data. For example, “sigmoid”
is suitable for networks where the output is in the range
[0, 1]. However, the “tanh” and “sigmoid” activation functions
saturate the neuron very fast and can vanish the gradient.
Despite “tanh”, the non-zero centered output from “sigmoid”
can cause unstable dynamics in the gradient updates for
the weights. The ReLU activation function leads to sparser
gradients and greatly accelerates the convergence of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) compared to the “sigmoid” or “tanh”
activation functions. ReLU is computationally cheap,
since it can be implemented by thresholding an activation
value at zero. However, ReLU is not resistant against a large
gradient flow and as the weight matrix grows, the neuron may
remain inactive during training.

\subsection{Loss Function}
Loss function evaluates performance of the network by
comparing the output $\mathbf{y}_t$ with the corresponding target $\mathbf{z}_t$
defined as
\begin{equation}
  L(\mathbf{y,z}) = \sum_{t=1}^T L_t(\mathbf{y_t, z_t})
\end{equation}
that is an overall summation of losses in each timestep.
Selection of the loss function is problem dependent. Some
popular loss function are Euclidean distance and Hamming
distance for forecasing of real-values and cross-entropy over
probablity distribution of outputs for classification problems. 
\section{Training Recurrent Neural Networks}
Efficient training of a RNN is a major problem. The
difficulty is in proper initialization of the weights in the network and the optimization algorithm to tune them in order
to minimize the training loss. The relationship among network
parameters and the dynamics of the hidden states through time
causes instability. A glance at the proposed methods in the
literature shows that the main focus is to reduce complexity
of training algorithms, while accelerating the convergence.
However, generally such algorithms take a large number of iterations to train the model. Some of the approaches for training
RNNs are multi-grid random search, time-weighted pseudonewton optimization, GD, extended Kalman filter (EKF),
Hessian-free, expectation maximization (EM), approx-
imated Levenberg-Marquardt, and global optimization
algorithms.
\subsection{Initialization}
Initialization of weights and biases in RNNs is critical.
A general rule is to assign small values to the weights. A
Gaussian draw with a standard deviation of 0.001 or 0.01 is a
reasonable choice. The biases are usually set to zero,
but the output bias can also be set to a very small value.
However, the initialization of parameters is dependent on the
task and properties of the input data such as dimensionality .
Setting the initial weight using prior knowledge or in a semi-supervised fashion are other approaches.
\subsection{Gradient-based Learning Methods}
Gradient descent (GD) is a simple and popular optimization
method in deep learning. The basic idea is to adjust the
weights of the model by finding the error function derivatives
with respect to each member of the weight matrices in the
model. To minimize total loss, GD changes each weight
in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to
that weight, provided that the non-linear activation functions
are differentiable. The GD is also known as batch GD,
as it computes the gradient for the whole dataset in each
optimization iteration to perform a single update as
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\lambda}{U}\sum_{k=1}^U \pdv{L_k}{\theta}
\end{equation}
where $U$ is size of training set, $\lambda$ is the learning rate, and $\theta$ is
set of parameters. This approach is computationally expensive
for very large datasets and is not suitable for online training \\

If you are familiar with training techniques for Feedforward Neural Networks such as backpropagation
one question which might arise is how to properly backpropagate the error through a RNN. Here, a
technique called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is used. However, computing
error-derivatives through time is difficult. This is mostly
due to the relationship among the parameters and the dynamics
of the RNN, that is highly unstable and makes GD ineffective.
Gradient-based algorithms have difficulty in capturing depen-
dencies as the duration of dependencies increases. The
derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights
only consider the distance between the current output and the
corresponding target, without using the history information for
weights updating. RNNs cannot learn long-range temporal dependencies when GD is used for training. This is due
to the exponential decay of gradient, as it is back-propagated
through time, which is called the vanishing gradient problem.
In another occasional situation, the back-propagated gradient
can exponentially blow-up, which increases the variance of
the gradients and results in very unstable learning situation,
called the exploding gradient problem.
\subsection{Back-propagation through time (BPTT)}
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the adaption of the backpropagation algorithm for RNNs. In theory, this unfolds the RNN to construct a traditional Feedfoward Neural Network where
we can apply backpropagation. For that, we use the same notations for the RNN as proposed before. \\


Since we have three weight matrices $\mathbf{W}_{xh}$, $\mathbf{W}_{hh}$ and $\mathbf{W}_{ho}$ we need to compute the partial derivative to each of these weight matrices. With the chain rule which is also used in normal backpropagation we get to the result for $\mathbf{W}_{ho}$ shown in Equation 10.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{ho}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \pdv{\phi_o}{\mathbf{W}_{ho}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{H}_t
\end{equation}
For the partial derivative with respect to $\mathbf{W}_{hh}$ we get the result shown in Equation 11.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \pdv{\phi_o}{\mathbf{H}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\phi_h} \cdot \pdv{\phi_h}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}}
= \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\phi_h} \cdot \pdv{\phi_h}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}}
\end{equation}
For the partial derivative with respect to $\mathbf{W}_{xh}$ we get the result shown in Equation 12.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \pdv{\phi_o}{\mathbf{H}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\phi_h} \cdot \pdv{\phi_h}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}}
  = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\phi_h} \cdot \pdv{\phi_h}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}}
\end{equation}

Since each Ht depends on the previous time step we can substitute the last part from above equations
to get Equation 13 and Equation 14.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \sum_{k=1}^t \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\mathbf{H}_k} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_k}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \sum_{k=1}^t \pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\mathbf{H}_k} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{H}_k}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}}
\end{equation}

The adapted part can then further be written as shown in Equation 15 and Equation 16.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \sum_{k=1}^t (\mathbf{W}_{hh}^T)^{t-k} \cdot \mathbf{H}_k
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L}{\mathbf{W}_{xh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{O}_t} \cdot \pdv{\mathbf{O}_t}{\phi_o} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{ho} \sum_{k=1}^t (\mathbf{W}_{hh}^T)^{t-k} \cdot \mathbf{X}_k
\end{equation}
From here, we can see that we need to store powers of $\mathbf{W}_{hh}^k$
hh as we proceed through each loss term $\ell_t$
of the overall loss function $L$ which can become very large. For these large values this method
becomes numerically unstable since eigenvalues smaller than 1 vanish and eigenvalues larger than 1
diverge. One method of solving this problem is truncate the sum at a computationally convenient
size. When you do this, you're using Truncated BPTT. This basically establishes an upper
bound for the number of time steps the gradient can flow back to. One can think of this upper
bound as a moving window of past time steps which the RNN considers. Anything before the cut-off
time step doesn't get taken into account. Since BPTT basically unfolds the RNN to create a new layer
for each time step we can also think of this procedure as limiting the number of hidden layers.

\section{Exploding and Vanishing Gradients}
While in principle the recurrent network is a simple
and powerful model, in practice, it is unfortunately
hard to train properly. Among the main reasons why
this model is so unwieldy are the vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems.
\subsection{The mechanics}
To understand this phenomenon we need to look at the
form of each temporal component, and in particular at
the matrix factors $\pdv{\mathbf{H}_t}{\mathbf{H}_k}$ that take the
form of a product of $t-k$ Jacobian matrices. \textit{In the
same way a product of $t-k$ real numbers can shrink
to zero or explode to infinity, so does this product of
matrices} (along some direction v).
In what follows we will try to formalize these intuitions where only a single hidden unit case was
considered).

If we consider a linear version of the model (i.e. set $\sigma$ to
the identity function in equation (1)) we can use the
power iteration method to formally analyze this product 
of Jacobian matrices and obtain tight conditions
for when the gradients explode or vanish (see the supplementary materials for a detailed derivation of these
conditions). It is sufficient for the largest eigenvalue
$\lambda_1$ of the recurrent weight matrix to be smaller than
1 for long term components to vanish (as $t \rightarrow \infty$) and
necessary for it to be larger than 1 for gradients to
explode.

We can generalize these results for nonlinear functions
$\sigma$ where the absolute values of $\sigma'(x)$ is bounded (say
by a value $\gamma \in R$) and therefore $||diag(\sigma'(\mathbf{H}_k))|| \le \gamma$.

We first prove that it is sufficient for $\lambda_1 < \frac{1}{\lambda}$ , where
$\lambda_1$ is the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of
the recurrent weight matrix Wrec, for the vanishing
gradient problem to occur. Note that we assume the
parametrization given by equation (1). The Jacobian
matrix $pdv{\mathbf{H}_{k+1}}{\mathbf{H}_k}$ is given by $\mathbf{W}_{hh}^T diag(\sigma'(\mathbf{H}_k))$. The 2-
norm of this Jacobian is bounded by the product of the norms of the two matrices (see equation (17)). Due
to our assumption, this implies that it is smaller than 1.
\begin{equation}
  \forall k, \bigg |\bigg | \pdv{\mathbf{H}_{k+1}}{\mathbf{H}_k} \bigg |\bigg | \le ||\mathbf{W}_{hh}^T||
  \mid\mid diag(\sigma'(\mathbf{H}_k))\mid\mid < \frac{1}{\gamma}\gamma < 1
\end{equation} 
Let $\eta \in R$ be such that $\forall k, \mid\mid \pdv{\mathbf{H}_{k+1}}{\mathbf{H}_k} \le \eta < 1$.The
existence of $\eta$ is given by equation (17). By induction
over i, we can show that
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{H}_t} \; (\prod_{i=k}^{t-1} \pdv{\mathbf{H}_{i+1}}{\mathbf{H}_i}) \le \eta^{t-k} \pdv{\ell_t}{\mathbf{H}_t}
\end{equation}

This equation shows that as $t-k$ gets larger, the long-term
dependencies move toward zero and the vanishing problem
happens. Finally, we can see that the sufficient condition for
the gradient vanishing problem to appear is that the largest
singular value of the recurrent weights matrix $\mathbf{W}_{hh} (i.e., \lambda_1)$
satisfies $\lambda_1 < \frac{1}{\gamma}$

vanishing gradient}
