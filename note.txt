The intelligence of humans, as well as most animals, depends
on having a memory of the past. This can be short-term,
as when combining sounds to make words, and long-term,
for example where the word ‘‘she’’ can refer back to ‘‘Anne’’
mentioned hundreds of words earlier. This is exactly what
RNN provides in neural networks. It adds feedback that
enables using the outputs of previous time step while process-
ing the current time-step input. It aims to add memory cells
that function similarly to human long-term and short-term
memories.
